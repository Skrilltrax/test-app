# test-app
Visitor test app using firebase and kotlin

## Firebase

Please add your own firebase json to link it to the firebase services.  
Also set all the rules to allow unauthenticated read/write access to the firebase database.  

## Bugs

There might be some bugs due to the amount of time i was able to give it.  
All the camera related crashes are due to camerakit api.  
I am also using a very old version of camerakit since the latest ones were very unstable.
